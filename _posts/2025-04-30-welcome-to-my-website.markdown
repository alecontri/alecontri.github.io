Hi! I am Alessandro Contri, a PhD Candidate in Computational Mathematics at [NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology][ntnu].

In this website you will find some updates regarding what I have been working on lately in my career. Hopefully, with time, I will also be able to add some curiosities I stumbled across along my journey that helped keeping me motivated.

<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %} -->
