About me
----

Nature is what sparks my curiosity daily and mathematical algorithms are the language I have chosen to understand it. Specifically, I love generating visually striking images from PDE simulations that accurately imitate naturally occurring phenomena.

As a PhD candidate in computational mathematics, I find excitement in developing the tools to simulate the mesmerizing world around us using mathematics, particularly numerical analysis. My current research focuses on Finite Element Methods to advance the modeling of fluid-deformable surfaces, such as cell membranes. In this context, I have developed new general proofs for the convergence of fluid simulations and am currently creating a Python package based on NgSolve to facilitate biological simulations involving moving boundaries.

My interests also include numerical methods for aerospace engineering (celestial mechanics) and structural mechanics (debris flow). While most of my career has been dedicated to meshed methods, I also have experience with particle methods and have received training in deep learning and parallel computing.

I am eager to explore new challenges in the world of computational science. Please feel free to reach out!
