1. **Introduction to Finite Elements**
   - **Nodes and Elements**: Discretization of a domain into simpler parts.
   - **Lax-Milgram Theorem**: Provides conditions for the existence of solutions to boundary value problems.

2. **Surface Finite Elements**
   - **Construction**: Adapting finite element methods to curved surfaces.
   - **Approximation Theorems**: Ensure that finite element solutions converge to the true solution as the mesh is refined.
